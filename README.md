## New Members

In order to add your picture and a link to your website on the "People" page of the site make the following changes and then make a pull request so your changes can be approved and incorporated into the official site.

1. Select a photo of yourself that you would like to have posted on the website. Make sure that it is *exactly* square (width = height). 

2. Put your photo in the `images/people` directory where the name of the image file is your name. 

3. Copy the following html and paste it directly above the commented line `<!-- NEW [STUDENT] ADD HERE -->`. Pay attention to where you put your html, and that your put yourself above the `<!-- NEW UNDERGRAD ADD HERE -->` if you're an undergrad or `<!-- NEW PHD STUDENT ADD HERE -->` if you're a PhD student, etc. 
   
   1. There are two options for the html, depending on whether you want to link your personal website, LinkedIn or something else with your name. The first option is above, where a website is linked. The second option, where a website is not linkedin, is listed below. 

```
                            <article class="col-3 col-12-mobile special">
                                <a class="image people"><img src="images/people/IMAGE_FILE_NAME" alt="" /></a>
                                <header>
                                    <h3><a href="INSERT WEBSITE URL HERE">YOUR NAME</a></h3>
                                </header>
                            </article>
```

```
                            <article class="col-3 col-12-mobile special">
                                <a class="image people"><img src="images/people/IMAGE_FILE_NAME" alt="" /></a>
                                <header>
                                    <h3>YOUR NAME</h3>
                                </header>
                            </article>
```

4. Once you've pasted the html in the appropriate place:

    1. replace the `IMAGE_FILE_NAME` with the image file name that you just put in the `images/people` directory (remember to include the extension, e.g., .png, jpg)

    2. replace `YOUR NAME` with your name

    3. if you have a website, and you want this page to link to it, replace the two `#` with your website url

5. Finally, commit your changes and make a pull request so that your changes are approved and reflected on the actual website.

## How to run a simple HTTP server to view the site locally

First, in a terminal, `cd` into this directory (uchicago-intro-robotics-winter-2021-website), then run:
```
python -m http.server
```

## Change the password

Currently, the password for the wiki is robots. To change the password, here is how one should go about it. 

1. Go to this website http://www.yaldex.com/FSPassProtect/AsciiEncryption.htm and replace the text in the first box with the desired password

2. Press the button Encrypt Box1 to Box2, and copy the output

3. Go to the file /assets/js/encryption.js and change the variable password in the function passWord() to the output copied earlier

## Add a wiki entry

Currently, the password for the wiki is robots. To change the password, here is how one should go about it. 

1. Go to the for_lab_members.html page 
    
    1. Above the comment that says "insert new wiki page" paste the following code

    ```
        <div class="wrapper style1">
                <section id="features" class="container special">
                    <div class="row pub-item2">
                        <article class="col-9 off-test col-12-mobile pub-details2">
                            <h3> <a href="/wiki/lab_protocol.html"> Robotics Lab Protocol </a> </h3>
                            <p>
                                Accessing the Robotics Lab (JCL 379) for Project Work.
                            </p>
                        </article>
                        <article class="col-2 col-12-mobile pub-venue-short">
                            <h3>
                                June 2020
                            </h3>
                        </article>
                    </div>
                </section>
            </div>
    ```

    2. Change the code copy pasted above to fit your needs (ie: change the date in the <h3> tag, change the title in the <p> tag and change the link to the page in the <a> tag)

2. Then, create a new html page in the wiki folder that is the link to the new wiki page

    1. It will be helpful if you copy the template in wiki/wiki_template.html. There are labels that you can use to organize bullet points, put in images, links or text. You may also find the lab_protocol.html page helpful as an example. 

    2. Note on images: all images should be put in the images folder, so they can be found as follows images/image_name.jpg (or .png)
