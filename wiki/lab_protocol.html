                    <p>Before you access the lab for the first time, you must get permission from Sarah to access the lab. She must put your name on the access list and have your access approved by the Computer Science Department and the PSD. Once you've
                        been approved for access, you must complete the COVID-19 <a href="https://goforward.uchicago.edu/health-requirements/" target="_blank">safety
                            training and signed the Health Attestation</a>. Even if you've already completed the general safety training, you'll also have to complete the training titled <a href="http://ehsa.uchicago.edu/training" target="_blank">Lab Based Researchers: COVID-19
                            Controlled Resumption of Research Activities (cvd-01W).</a></p>

                                <li>You can sign up for multiple time slots back-to-back and be there for the entire time (beginning to end). For example, if you sign up for the 1-3pm and 4-6pm time slots, you can be in the lab from 1pm to 6pm.</li>
                                <li>The purpose of this spreadsheet is to ensure that no more than 1 person is in the lab at any given time and that there is at least 1 hour of downtime in between each person's use of the lab. </li>

                                <li>If your phone camera doesn't register the QR code and take you to the page to sign in, you can use the link <a href="http://contact.cs.uchicago.edu/">contact.cs.uchicago.edu</a> and log in manually. </li>

                    <p>Sarah's JCL 379 lab access research resumption plan currently: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>allows for up to <b>4 people</b> to access the lab simultaneously, given that they remain 6 feet apart</li>
                            <li><b>no longer</b> has access groups (if you don't know what I'm referring to - you have nothing to worry about &#x1F642) - anyone who has access to JCL 379 can access the lab simultaneously as long as all parties are comfortable simultaneously occupying the lab and all other lab access policies are adhered to (e.g., PPE use, capacity limits, remaining 6 feet apart).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3><strong>Cleaning Supplies</strong> </h3>
                    <p>The cleaning supplies are located in labeled bins on the right-hand counter top when you enter the lab (see photo below, cleaning supplies are circled in light blue). </p>
